# Galindo_Portfolio

## Description 
This repo contains Jaquelin Galindo's portfolio. Using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a website that demonstrate's Jackie's work as a software engineer. Each page has a navigation bar. Each page follows the same [color palette](Images\color_palette.jpg). 

## Index 
This page is the Home Page of the project. Using a jumbtron from Bootstrap, I annouce who I am where I am from and provide a link to my resume. 

## About Me 
On this page I use Bootstrap cards to highlight different aspect of my life such as my education, hobbies, volunteer activities. 

## Portfolio
This page I use to highligh my technical skills. I breakdown the work I have done and link it to each repo. For the projects that do not have a repo do to contracted work I provide a detailed description of the role I had on the team and the value I provided. Again, I use bootstrap cards to highlight the different projects. 

## Contact 
On this page I provide the user a form to enter a message. Currently the submit button does not work, but will soon. Again I am leveraging Bootstrap to use a jumbtron. I also add an email icon for style.
